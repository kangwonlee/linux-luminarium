This module will teach you the basics of Linux file paths!
The Linux filesystem is a "tree".
That is, it has a root (written as `/`).
The root of the filesystem is a directory, and every directory can contain other directories and files.
You refer to files and directories by their _path_.
A path from the root of the filesystem starts with `/` (that is, the root of the filesystem), and describes the set of directories that must be descended into to find the file.
Every piece of the path is demarcated with another `/`.
Armed with this knowledge, go forth and tackle the challenges below.
